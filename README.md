x-miner
=======

Here are several implementations of file access pattern or correlation detectors, hoping I could apply them into one or more distributed file systems.

##C-Miner
I implemented the c-miner algorithm described in paper ¡®C-Miner: Mining Block Correlations in Storage Systems¡¯, but I use a different method to generate the closed frequent subsequences.
